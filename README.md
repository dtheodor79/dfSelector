# Bluetoot DF selector
 The Bluetooth DF (BDF) selector allows users to boot your Amiga 500 from an internal or external drive. Instead of using a mechanical switch or multiple reset sequences to toggle between DF0 and DF1, BDF can be configured wirelessly over a Bluetooth connection. 
 
# Why bother when there are already other DF selectors?
Well, all this started because I don't like modifying my A500's precious case (like installing a switch) ðŸ™‚. Also, I find more elegant using wireless commands to toggle between DF0 and DF1, than multiple resets ðŸ˜Ž.
 
# Concept
The BDF concept is illustrated below:

Pins 13 (sel0) and 14 (sel1) from 8520A (even CIA) are connected to an MCU with wireless connection capability. Users can configure from an exteneral device how these signals are forwarded to the A500 motherboard (MB), in order to select from which floppy drive the computer shall boot. 


# Implementation
The image below shows a BDF 3D model that is implemented with an ESP32 MCU, which enables switch configuration over Bluetooth connections:

A voltage convertor between 3.3V and 5V is used to allow communication between the ESP32 (3.3V) and the 8520A (5V). In addition, since the BDF relies above the floppy ribbon cable connector of the A500, it uses long pin headers (such as the one below) to connect to the A500 MB:

Here are a few images of the final prototype on my A500:

# How to use the ESP32-based implementation
The current ESP32 firmware advertises a Bluetooth-enabled device with the name "A500 DF Selector". You will need another Bluetooth-enabled device to connect to the BDF and then send raw data for configuring the sel0 and sel1 switching. The easiest way would be to download a simple Bluetooth app to your smartphone that allows to send raw data to other devices.

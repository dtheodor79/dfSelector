# Wireless DF selector
 The Wireless DF (WDF) selector allows users to boot an Amiga 500 from an internal or external drive. Instead of using a mechanical switch or multiple reset sequences to toggle between DF0 and DF1, WDF can be configured over a wireless connection. 
 
# Why bother?
Well, all this started because I don't like modifying my A500's precious case (like drilling to install a switch) üôÇ. Also, I find more elegant using wireless commands to toggle between DF0 and DF1, than multiple resets üòé.
 
# Concept
The WDF concept is illustrated below: 

![concept](/images/concept.png)

Pins 13 (sel0) and 14 (sel1) from 8520A (even CIA) are connected to an MCU with wireless connection capability. Users can configure from an exteneral device how these signals are forwarded to the A500 motherboard (MB), in order to select from which floppy drive the computer shall boot. 

# Implementation
The images below show three WDF 3D models that are implemented with an ESP32 MCU, enabling switch configuration over Bluetooth connections:

ESP32 "in front" of 8520A (tested):

ESP32 "behind" 8520A (not tested):

ESP32 "stacked" on top of 8520A (not tested):

A voltage convertor between 3.3V and 5V is used to allow communication between the ESP32 (3.3V) and the 8520A (5V). In addition, since the first WDF version (ESP32 "in front" of 8520A) is placed above the floppy ribbon cable connector of the A500, it requires long pin headers (such as the one below) to connect to the A500 MB:

# How to use the ESP32-based implementation
The current ESP32 firmware advertises a Bluetooth-enabled device with the name "A500 DF Selector". You will need another Bluetooth-enabled device to connect to the WDF and then send raw data for configuring the sel0 and sel1 switching. An easy way is to download a simple Bluetooth app to your smartphone that allows sending raw data to other devices. 

## Toggle DF1 as bootable:

* Make sure that there is no disk in DF0.
* Power-up the A500 and wait for few secs (e.g. 5).
* Scan for the "A500 DF Selector" device, and when found, connect to it.
* Send "df1".
* Power-down the A500 for a few secs.
* Power-up again, and now the A500 should boot from DF1.

## Toggle DF0 as bootable:

* Make sure that there is no disk (or adf image that will boot) in DF1.
* Power-up the A500 and wait for few secs (e.g. 5).
* Scan for the "A500 DF Selector" device, and when found, connect to it.
* Send "df0".
* Power-down the A500 for a few secs.
* Power-up again, and now the A500 should boot from DF0.

# Important notes
- All tests were carried out with a modified PC-floppy as DF0 and a Gotek emulator as DF1 (but jumper set to S0). Actually floppy selection could be done seamlessly without even restarting the A500 üí£ by sending "df0" and "df1" commands when there was no floppy access. If you would like to try it, please be careful and always make sure that before sending any command that there is no floppy access (don't blame me if there is any damage though üòõ). 
- When DF0 is selected, the current firmware  
  - forwards sel0 (8520A) ‚û°Ô∏è sel0 (A500 MB)
  - sets sel1 (A500 MB) ‚û°Ô∏è HIGH
- When DF1 is selected, the current firmware  
  - forwards sel0 (8520A) ‚û°Ô∏è sel1 (A500 MB)
  - forwards sel1 (8520A) ‚û°Ô∏è sel0 (A500 MB)

Feel free to change how the firmware handles switching, so it suits to your configuration üòâ.
